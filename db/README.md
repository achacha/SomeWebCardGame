  		- sudo su postgres (this sets you as the postgres user)
  		- psql (this launches the postgres command line)
  		- CREATE USER sawcog WITH PASSWORD 'cogsaw';
  	alternatively, use a postgres tool like pgadmin3
  	
  . Alter user sawcog so that it has CREATEDB permission
  	to do this manually, type the following into the postgres command line:
  	- ALTER USER sawcog WITH CREATEDB;
  	
  . Create database necropolis and assign it to user sawcog
  	to do this manually, type the following into the postgres command line:
  	- CREATE DATABASE necropolis WITH OWNER sawcog;
  
  . Test connection to verify that sawcog user can login and use necropolis database
  	
  	psql -d necropolis -U sawcog -W -h localhost
